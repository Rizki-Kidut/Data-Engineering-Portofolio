# Data Engineering Portofolio

Hello my name is Rizki Hidayat, a Chemical Engineering who try to learn Data Engineering. This is my Data Engineering project.

## 1. Data Cleansing
In this project, I perform data cleansing in Telco Dataset. In this process, I handled missing values, duplicate data, and outliers in the dataset. 

This is the detail of my data cleansing project [Data Cleansing in Telco Dataset.](https://github.com/Rizki-Kidut/Data-Engineering-Portofolio/blob/main/Data_Cleansing.ipynb)

## 2. Simple ETL project with Pandas Dataframe
In this project, I perform simple ETL process using Pandas Dataframe to the registration data for a hackathon organized by DQLab called DQThon.
